    Task: Create a Docker Compose setup for a web application consisting of a frontend and a backend.
    
    Backend:
    - Implement a Spring Boot application that serves a simple HTML page with a greeting message.
    
    Frontend:
    - Develop a Node.js application using TypeScript and React.
    - Utilize Material-UI for styling the frontend components.
    - The frontend should fetch the greeting message from the backend and display it on the page.
    
    Requirements:
    - Use Docker Compose to orchestrate both frontend and backend services.
    - Ensure that the frontend can communicate with the backend service.
*/
```

This comment effectively summarizes the task, outlining both the backend and frontend requirements, as well as the technologies to be used and the goal of the project.
