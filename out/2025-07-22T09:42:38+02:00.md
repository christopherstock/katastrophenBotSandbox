This Python script contains functions to generate prompts for generating the necessary Docker Compose setup and Dockerfiles for both the backend and frontend services. You can run this script to see the generated prompts. 

Keep in mind that the actual implementation of the Spring Boot and Node.js applications is not included in this script, but you can create those applications separately as per the requirements.
